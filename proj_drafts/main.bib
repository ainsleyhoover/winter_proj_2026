Situated within postdigital discourse, the course treats laptops and portable digital devices as musical instruments within a hybrid classroom, fostering collaborative, creative, and embodied learning experiences. Drawing on Hartmut Rosa’s theory of
resonance
, this study examines how spatial design and technology-mediated interactions in PULSE cultivate a
Resonanzraum
—a dynamic space of mutual transformation. Through qualitative methods, including (1) a student survey, (2) autoethnographic reflections, and (3) an analysis of audio-visual data, we identify six themes that contribute to the emergence of resonance: (1) spatial comfort, (2) collaboration, (3) spatial constraints/affordances, (4) technology-mediated agency, (5) iterative learning, and (6) future classroom implications. The findings suggest that PULSE creates an inclusive postdigital educational space that enhances student agency and multimodal engagement. However, scalability challenges, such as resource disparities, highlight the need for adaptive implementations. This study aims to bridge
resonance
and postdigital research, proposing PULSE as a model for designing equitable, sustainable, and participatory learning spaces that align with evolving pedagogical demands.},

We found that indicators of stratification position, race, region, religion, and political socialization have exerted a nearly constant causal influence on party throughout the twenty-year period. A model which assumed constant effects (equal regression slopes) across the six elections explained only 2\% less of the variance in party than a model which allowed the slopes to vary across elections. Of the variables in the causal model, socialization--as indicated by father's party preference--has the largest effect on party affiliation. The addition to our model of the demographic variables, age and cohort, revealed that both factors influence individuals' party affiliations. Though age and cohort explain only a small portion of the variance in party, examination of the net differences in mean party affiliation between age groups and between cohorts showed that aging does produce a net shift away from the Democratic party and that the Depression has had lasting effects on the preferences of cohort members formulating their preferences at that time.},

Contrary to expectations, demographic sorting has not produced a very predictable electorate.

Moreover, demographics’ predictive power over vote choice or partisan affiliation shows a surprising stability over time. We argue that while select demographics’ marginal effects may appear to be evidence of social sorting, the joint predictability of political behavior using only demographic characteristics has been, and still is, modest at best.},

Yet, there is a diversity of party identification even within demographic groups which have historically been attached to one party. And some groups lack a clear connection to either party. It may be that demographics on their own fail to account for the fact that people generally belong to a variety of groups. They must select the groups which are most important to them when shaping a political identity, and may choose to construct an identity relatively unattached to any specific demographic group to which they belong. This prompts the question, do we need to consider measures of identity strength when using demographics to explain party identification? We utilize a predictive framework to address these questions and find that demographics are highly predictive for some groups (e.g., Black Democrats), while others benefit from the inclusion of identity strength (e.g., Hispanic Republicans).},
